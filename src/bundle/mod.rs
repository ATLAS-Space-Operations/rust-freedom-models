//! # Bundles
//!
//! The Freedom API exposes several bundles for consumption by other applications and processes
//! to reduce the set of calls required to fetch specific data.
//!
//! In general, these bundles are not intended for general consumption, and should not be relied
//! upon as part of the stable API.
